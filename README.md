# Description

This my personal console configuration files used in Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS. It will override the default Ubuntu Terminal settings and make the console more informative and Mac like. Though I use it on my Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS edition, it should work perfectly on other edition of Linux.

## List of Files

`.bashrc`

1. Changed `HISTSIZE` from 1000 to 10000
2. Changed `HISTFILESIZE`from 2000 to 20000 so that the system can store more history
2. Uncommented `Line 43` to make console colorful
3. Changed `line 57` console output to make console a bit informative and Mac Like :)
