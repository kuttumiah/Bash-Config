Bash-Config
===========

This my personal console configuration files used in Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS. It will override the default Ubuntu Terminal settings and make the console more informative and Mac like. Though I use it on my Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS edition, it should work perfectly on other edition of Linux.
